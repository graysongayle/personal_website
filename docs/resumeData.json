I've been verablly and emotionally abused by Mark Gould to become the greatest lip buzzer the world has ever seen. I will wipe you out at NTC and ITG. Tomasi is childs play. Jolivet is a joke. You think you have what it takes? Think again, fucker. I can be anywhere, anytime, and can play a scale in over seven hundred ways, you worm. Not only am I classically trained in unarmed combat, I've been known to squash the jazzers with my bare hands. If only you would have held your tongue. I will have you blasted to smithereens on trumpetherald, and you will drown in your trumpet spit, you little shit. ",
